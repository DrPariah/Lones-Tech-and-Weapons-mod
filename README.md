   Hello! When you go to add my mod to your game it will seperate Lones tweaks (the core mod), translocator gates, Wearable UPS, Lones Flesh raptors and CBM slot rebalance. 
   
The idea with my mod, is to allow ANYONE to delete things they dont need.

The idea behind this is to have a mod where you can delete what you dont like and add what you want. Transparency. 
Hopefully this mod adds some things you like, and most of all ENJOY!


Lones tweaks (the core mod),
Lones Wearable UPS,
Lones Flesh raptors,
Lones Translocator gates
Lones CBM slot rebalance

I added colors to each mod in my pack to easily show you. See screenshot above. 

   This is to make it easier to not add anything you may not want. Simply don't select the mod in world gen! The core of the mod, 
is items that I felt were not in the game, or just fun guns or pieces of tech. There is refrences to other games as well. 
Who doesnt love refences? This mod is slowly getting bigger so if anyone has any ideas on some cool tech or some cool prototype guns,
let me know! You can reach me on the BN discord or on my own discord.
